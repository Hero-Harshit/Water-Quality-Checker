                    <p> This site is the result of a highly scientific process called "doing whatever will get me marks while pretending it's for the greater good." My college thought it would be a great idea to force students into Community Engagement Projects because nothing screams helping society like being graded on it. </p>
                    
                    <p> I decided to make a Water Quality Checker Website. Why? Because I like the irony of using a laptop, Wi-Fi, my mediocre coding skills , and half a dozen of my sanity to tell you that your water might be garbage & suitable for drinking. (like you can't tell that by yourself ? Man, your sense of taste, smell & sight are questionable) </p>

                    <p> Is this going to change the world ? Probably not. The environment ? Sure, I care… as long as my marks come first. After all, what's the point of saving the planet if you can't pass your semester ? Get a back... Be unemployed .... Die a loser !</p>
                    
                    <p> In conclusion, this project stands proudly at the intersection of education bureaucracy, sarcastic self-motivation, and the bare minimum needed to get pass. Also on a side note from the creator. If you are using this website to check the water quality and whether it is safe to drink it or not, then whichever god you believe in I really hope that he/she/they/them blesses you !!!  </p>

                    <p> The original idea of this was given by Swapnil & Vinay. Which was then green lighted by the faculty (whatever her name was). Then the task of bringing this idea to life was assigned to who was all alone who needed a group to desperately join. So now, here I am working my back off on this. But secretly I have a hidden & bigger motive. What is that ? Wait & Watch..... </p>

                    <p> I dont know about my team, but I do have a lot of long term plans about developing this site. Not only for CEP but as a side project for myself to test & implement things which I have learnt. What are those exact plan ? I don't want to spoil my plans by telling you all, also there is a high change I might over commit something and then not deliver on it. If you want to know about changelog, version history, the code behind this website then check out the settings page. </p>
